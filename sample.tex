Your introduction should be here. You may need a reference~\cite{ref_sample}.

\section{Second section} 

My second section starts with my equation, which can be written as 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:myeq}
\begin{split}
	A 		&= B + C, \\
    D + E	&= F.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Thus we have (\ref{eq:myeq}).

Fig.~\ref{fig:myfigure} is a sample figure. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{myfigure.pdf}
\caption{My figure.} \label{fig:myfigure}
