	abstract = {High-fidelity life-cycle coupling simulations are attractive for increasing reactor power, increasing the fuel burnup and prolonging the reactor lifetime, which makes reactors much more economical. In this work, the continuous energy Reactor Monte Carlo code RMC was coupled to the subchannel code CTF. With the great support of the high-performance computing techniques, the coupled codes were then used to analyze VERA benchmark Problem 9 for the depletion of the fuel and burnable absorbers in a typical 18-month fuel cycle. Existing Monte Carlo burnup codes suffer from instabilities caused by spatial xenon oscillations. Therefore, a xenon equilibrium correction based on a simplified xenon-iodine burnup chain was used to restrain the spatial xenon oscillations and to improve simulation stability. The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics coupling convergence were investigated in terms of power distribution and Keff. The power distribution and Keff variations show that the neutronics/thermal-hydraulics coupling converges in the third iteration. To verify the neutronics/thermal-hydraulics coupling, the critical boron search algorithm and equilibrium xenon correction method, RMC/CTF solutions to a nominal flow and power critical calculation, VERA Benchmark Problem 7, were compared with the VERA reference solutions (MPACT/CTF) and MC21/CTF. The maximum relative difference of radial assembly power between this work and reference solutions was 2.8\%. For the VERA Benchmark Problem 9, the measured critical boron concentrations were provided to validate coupling codes. The critical boron concentration prediction by RMC/CTF is consistent with the measured boron concentrations with absolute errors within 20 ppm, which is about 200 pcm in reactivity. The RMC/CTF solution for VERA Core Physics Benchmark Problem 9 is the first published coupled Monte Carlo neutronics/subchannel thermal-hydraulics solution for this problem.},

	title = {Methods for including multiphysics feedback in {Monte} {Carlo} reactor physics calculations},
	abstract = {The ability to model and simulate nuclear reactors during steady state and transient conditions is important for designing efficient and safe nuclear power systems. The accurate simulation of a nuclear reactor is particularly challenging because the multiple physical processes within the reactor are tightly coupled, which requires that the numerical methods used to resolve each physical process can accurately and efficiently transfer and utilize data from other applications. Monte Carlo methods are desirable for solving the neutron transport equation required in reactor analysis because of the inherent accuracy of the method, but the Computational Solid Geometry (CSG) representation of the physical geometry makes it difficult to accurately and efficiently perform multiphysics reactor analyses with other applications that utilize finite element or finite volume representations. To address this limitation, a multiphysics coupling framework that minimizes the need for spatial discretization in the Monte Carlo geometry is presented in this thesis. The coupling framework uses Functional Expansion Tallies to transfer multiphysics information from the Monte Carlo application to other multiphysics tools. Additionally, the coupling framework uses a modified method for transporting neutrons through spatially continuous total macroscopic cross section distributions in order to incorporate continuous multiphysics feedback fields such as fuel temperature and coolant density into the Monte Carlo simulation. It has been shown that separable Zernike and Legendre Function Expansion Tallies can effectively reconstruct a continuous distribution of fission power density. Additionally, using a prototypical three-dimensional Light Water Reactor pin cell, the method used to transport neutrons through a continuously varying fuel temperature and coolant density distribution was shown to be 1.7 times faster than a comparable discretized simulation with volume-averaged properties, while still providing a high level of accuracy. Finally, in order to make the overall multiphysics coupling scheme useful for reactor analyses, a novel spatially continuous depletion methodology was developed and investigated. With the spatially continuous depletion methodology, number densities can be represented as a linear combination of polynomials, and those polynomial representations can be integrated through time to predict reactor operation. The spatially continuous depletion methodology was able to accurately predict the eigenvalue and number density distributions in a two-dimensional LWR pin cell depletion containing Gd-157 from a 2 weight percent GdO2 and seven other nuclides in the depletion matrix. Analyses of the spatially continuous depletion methodology showed that significant reductions in the number of tallied values could be achieved if polynomial representations were optimized for each nuclide reaction rate. From the depletion simulations in this thesis, a 23\% reduction in the required number of reaction rate tallies compared to a lower-fidelity, 10 radial ring pin discretization was shown to be achievable with nuclide polynomial optimization. In addition to showing potential for reductions in tally memory and computational requirements, the spatially continuous depletion simulation was shown to be equal in computational performance to a discrete simulation with 10 radial rings and 8 azimuthal cuts, while providing a much higher level of spatial fidelity in number density concentrations.},

	abstract = {Based on the characteristics of heat pipe cooled reactors, this study presents a new multi-physics coupling method by employing the Monte Carlo transport code RMC and the open-source code OpenFOAM. Three typical physical processes are considered, i.e., the neutron transport, the heat conduction and the thermal expansion. To conduct the steady-state coupling calculation, an investigation is conducted on the thermal deformation simulation, the expansion reactivity feedback, the mesh mapping and the coupling method between two codes. By employing this method, the coupling calculation on a typical heat pipe cooled reactor named KRUSTY (Kilowatt Reactor Using Stirling TechnologY) is conducted. Compared with the existing results, the correctness of this method is verified. As indicated from the calculation, the reactivity feedback attributed to thermal expansion is dominant, which is nearly 90\% of total reactivity feedback. Specific to fuel deformation, the thermal expansion primarily takes place on the “upper” and “lower” surfaces. As impacted by the high thermal conductivity of fuel, the total temperature difference in the reactor core is sufficiently small, which only reaches about 26K. The results and comparisons reveal the availability and feasibility of this coupling method, and such a method can effectively analyze heat pipe cooled reactors.},

	abstract = {Heat pipe cooled reactors are solid-state, high temperature reactors with significant thermal expansion which influences the neutronics and thermal analyses. The heat pipe operating conditions determine the heat transfer rates and temperature distribution which then affect the core neutronic and thermal–mechanical behavior, especially during heat pipe failure accidents where the radial heat flux is uneven. A two-phase two-dimensional heat pipe model was developed and coupled to a previous neutronic and thermal–mechanical (N/T-M) model. The coupled neutronic, thermal–mechanical and heat pipe heat transfer (N/T-M/HP) strategy is described here with a focus on the iteration schemes, physical mapping and geometry reconstruction. The coupled N/T-M/HP method was then applied to the KRUSTY heat pipe cooled reactor, an experimental solid-state reactor designed to power space missions. The power distribution and reactivity predicted by the coupled method are validated against previous simulations for the KRUSTY design. The heat pipe model predictions are compared with heat pipe experiments which show that the predicted heat pipe wall temperature is within 30 K of the measured temperatures. A steady-state normal operating case and a single heat pipe failure accident were then simulated to show the redundancy and reliability of the solid-state reactor. For the normal case, the thermal–mechanical feedback is ∼850 pcm from the cold state to the hot state. The heat transfer rate into each heat pipe is very stable during the iterations. For the single heat pipe failure accident, the heat pipes adjacent to the failure area are the most affected, with those heat loads increasing from 500 W to 640 W and an operating temperature rising by 16 K. In addition, the single heat pipe failure accident significantly increases the stress concentration in the fuel contacted with the failed heat pipe wall, with the peak stress increasing from 53 MPa to 80 MPa, which is very close to the yield stress. Therefore, the mechanical performance of the solid-state reactor should be carefully analyzed during design and operation.},
