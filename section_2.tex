\section{Spatially Continuous Material Properties} \label{s2}

This section provides the theoretical background for MC coupled multi-physics simulations with spatially continuous materials. Section \ref{sec21} explains the theory behind Functional Expansion Tally (FET), followed by the calculation of the polynomial basis required for FET in section \ref{sec22}. The variance estimation of the reconstructed power is briefly discussed in section \ref{sec22a}. The use of delta-tracking for spatially continuous materials is described in section \ref{sec23}, along with the computation of majorant cross sections in section \ref{sec24}. Finally, section \ref{sec25} summarizes the calculation flow for MC coupled multi-physics simulations with spatially continuous materials.

\subsection{Functional Expansion Tally} \label{sec21}

In the FET methodology \cite{gries, ellis}, the actual power shape solution is approximated through a truncated linear combination of polynomials, with MC tallies used to calculate the coefficients of these polynomials. Therefore, the spatially continuous power distribution can be approximated using FET by expanding the tally quantity into a linear combination of polynomials $\psi(\vec{\xi})$, as shown below:
\begin{equation}
    f\left(\vec{\xi}\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{{\bar{a}}_nk_n\psi_n\left(\vec{\xi}\right)},
    \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    {\bar{a}}_n=\left\langle f,\psi_n\right\rangle=\int_{\Gamma}{f\left(\vec{\xi}\right)\psi_n\left(\vec{\xi}\right)\rho\left(\vec{\xi}\right)d\vec{\xi}\ }.
    \label{eq2}
\end{equation}
Here, ${\bar{a}}_n$ represents the expansion coefficients, $\vec{\xi}$ denotes the neutron phase space comprising $\left(\vec{r},\hat{\mathrm{\Omega}},E\right)$, and $k_n$ is the normalization constant, which can be determined based on the chosen polynomial basis set that can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    k_n=\frac{1}{||\psi_n||^2},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    ||\psi_n||^2=\int_{\Gamma}{\psi_n^2\left(\vec{\xi}\right)\rho\left(\vec{\xi}\right)d}\vec{\xi}\ .
    \label{eq4}
\end{equation}
Lastly, the $\rho\left(\vec{\xi}\right)$ is the weighting function that shall be both complete and orthogonal with respect to $\psi_n\left(\vec{\xi}\right)$.

Fortunately, the integrals required to obtain the expansion coefficients in Eq. \ref{eq2} can be easily calculated in MC simulations using both analog and collision-based estimators. The unbiased collision-based estimator for the coefficients ${\bar{a}}_n$, used to reconstruct the power (as per Eq. \ref{eq1}), is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    {\bar{a}}_n=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\sum_{k=1}^{K_i}{w_{i,k}\frac{\kappa\left({\vec{\xi}}_{i,k}\right)}{\Sigma_t\left({\vec{\xi}}_{i,k}\right)}}\psi_n\left({\vec{\xi}}_{i,k}\right)\rho\left({\vec{\xi}}_{i,k}\right)}.
    \label{eq5}
\end{equation}
In Eq. \ref{eq5}, $N$ represents the total number of particles in each batch, $K_i$ is the total number of collisions for particle $i$, $w_{i,k}$ is the weight of particle $i$ at collision $k$, $\kappa\left({\vec{\xi}}_{i,k}\right)$ is the energy released per fission at the phase space point ${\vec{\xi}}_{i,k}$, and $\mathrm{\Sigma}_\mathrm{t}\left({\vec{\xi}}_{i,k}\right)$ is the total macroscopic cross section at the phase space point ${\vec{\xi}}_{i,k}$.

While any polynomial basis can be used, a set of orthogonal polynomials is generally preferred. By choosing the weighting function $\rho\left(\vec{\xi}\right)$ as the zeroth order of an orthogonal polynomial set, which equals unity, Eq. \ref{eq4} and Eq. \ref{eq5} can be simplified.

FET implementation often assumes that the solutions are separable. For instance, in cylindrical geometry, the solution is assumed to be separable as:
\begin{equation}
f\left(r,\theta,z\right)=g\left(r,\theta\right)h\left(z\right).
\end{equation}
This separability offers two key advantages: (1) it significantly reduces memory requirements, especially for large core problems involving Xenon feedback, and (2) it improves particle tracking efficiency by reducing the number of coefficients that need to be tallied. Numerical experiments have demonstrated that separable FET provides a reasonable approximation for non-separable distributions, achieving this at a fraction of the computational cost compared to the fully coupled solution \cite{gries}.

One limitation of the FET method is that its polynomials are primarily effective for approximating smooth distributions, with accuracy decreasing when applied to functions with discontinuities, such as those found in the axial power profile due to the presence of spacer grids. As proposed by Griesheimer \cite{gries}, this issue can be mitigated by using a piecewise expansion. In this approach, a tally region with known discontinuities is divided into two or more smaller regions, each expected to have a continuous solution, resulting in more accurate approximations.

\subsection{Polynomials Calculation} \label{sec22}

As discussed earlier, although any polynomial basis can be used, a set of orthogonal polynomials is generally preferred. In reactor calculations, Legendre and Zernike polynomials are most commonly used. Legendre polynomials serve as the basis for approximating functions in rectangular geometries, while Zernike polynomials are used for cylindrical geometries, such as fuel pellets.

The construction of Legendre polynomials can be done recursively as given by:
\begin{equation}
    P_n\left(x\right)=\frac{\left(2n-1\right)xP_{n-1}\left(x\right)-\left(n-1\right)P_{n-2}\left(x\right)}{n},
\end{equation}
with $P_0=1$ and $P_1=x$. Note that when constructing the polynomials, the variable must be scaled into its domain. For example, the Legendre polynomials' variable x must be scaled over the interval $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, if Legendre polynomials need to be calculated across the axial direction of an active reactor core, for instance, from 11.951 cm to 377.711 cm, the variables in the range $[11.951, 377.711]$ must be scaled to the range $[-1, 1]$.

Zernike polynomials form an orthogonal set of polynomials defined on a unit disk. They have traditionally been widely applied in optics, particularly in wavefront analysis due to their ability to represent circularly symmetric functions efficiently. The first four orders of Zernike polynomials are plotted in Figure \ref{fig_21}.

The radial componenents of Zernike is usually calculated using Eq. \ref{eq6}
\begin{equation}
R_n^m(r) = \sum_{s=0}^{\frac{n-m}{2}} (-1)^s \frac{(n-s)!}{s! \left( \frac{n+m}{2} - s \right)! \left( \frac{n-m}{2} - s \right)!} r^{n-2s}
\label{eq6}
\end{equation}
In this work, however, we introduce a highly efficient method for constructing the radial components of Zernike polynomials for FET. This approach is based on the recursive technique described in \cite{honarvar}, where the radial components are calculated through the following relation:
\begin{equation}
    R_n^m\left(r\right)=r\left[R_{n-1}^{\left|m-1\right|}\left(r\right)+R_{n-1}^{m+1}\left(r\right)\right]-R_{n-2}^m\left(r\right)\ .
    \label{eq7}
\end{equation}
In this way, $R_2^0$, $R_3^1$, and $R_n^m$ for $n=m$ can be determined manually, then followed by the computation of the rest polynomials using using Eq. \ref{eq7}.

    \label{fig_21}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{tab_z} presents a comparison of the CPU time required to calculate the radial components of the Zernike polynomials a million times using Eq. \ref{eq7} and Eq. \ref{eq6}. As indicated in the table, Eq. \ref{eq7} provides a more efficient approach for calculating the radial components of Zernike polynomials, particularly at higher orders. This increased efficiency is attributed to its recursive nature, which reduces the number of mathematical operations compared to the conventional method in Eq. \ref{eq6}. This implementation of Zernike polynomial computation represents the first application of this method in FET for reactor core simulations.

\end{table}

Once these radial components are established, the complete Zernike polynomials can be derived in a usual fashion. However, for MC multi-physics applications in this study, the constructions the radial components for $m=0$ only are sufficient under the assumption that power variation within the fuel pellet occurs predominantly along the radial direction, with uniformity along the azimuthal direction.

\subsection{Variance Estimation}\label{sec22a}

Variance estimation is an integral part in the MC simulations, as lower variance increases confidence in the results. In the implementation of FET in this study, although FET coefficients are tallied during particle tracking, their variances are not directly calculated. Instead, the variances of the reconstructed tallies are computed, as the primary goal of the calculations is not the coefficients themselves but the reconstructed tallies, such as power and reaction rates. The estimated variances for the reconstructed tallies from FET are calculated in a similar manner to other tallied quantities in MC simulations.

\subsection{Delta-tracking} \label{sec23}

Due to the continuous variation of material properties across the fuel pin, delta-tracking is employed as an alternative to conventional surface-tracking. The delta-tracking method differs from conventional surface-to-surface ray-tracing in that it allows the neutron random walk to continue through multiple material regions without terminating the particle track at each boundary surface.

Delta-tracking, as described in \cite{leppanen_2017, woodcock}, makes the total interaction probability uniform in all materials by introducing majorant cross sections. This allows for the uniform sampling of the distance to collision, given by:

\begin{equation}
    s = -\frac{\ln{\left(\xi\right)}}{\Sigma_{maj}(E)},
    \label{eq8}
\end{equation}
where \(\xi\) is a uniformly distributed random variable on the interval \([0,1]\), and \(\Sigma_{maj}(E)\) is the majorant cross section. In this study, to improve rejection sampling efficiency, the interaction probability is made uniform only within the delta-tracking region, which is typically defined at the assembly level. 

To preserve the physical nature of neutron transport while allowing the neutron random walk to continue through multiple material regions, the interaction probability in each material is adjusted by introducing virtual collisions. These are rejected collisions based on the total cross section at the neutron's collision site. In practice, this involves rejection sampling, where the collision is only accepted as a physical collision with the probability:

\begin{equation}
    p = \frac{\Sigma_t(\vec{r},E)}{\Sigma_{maj}(E)}.
    \label{eq9}
\end{equation}

If the probability $p$ obtained in Eq. \ref{eq9} is smaller than the newly sampled random number $\xi$, the collision is rejected as virtual. In this case, a new distance to collision is sampled using Eq. \ref{eq8}, and the neutron random walk is continued. Conversely, if $p \geq \xi$, the collision is accepted as a physical collision, where the actual neutron interaction is simulated and the tally is performed. Although the value of the majorant cross section can be chosen arbitrarily, setting it too high can reduce the efficiency of the rejection sampling procedure. Therefore, it is common practice to choose the majorant cross section as:
\begin{equation}
    \Sigma_{maj}(E) = \max{\left[\Sigma_t(\vec{r},E)\right]}.
    \label{eq10}
\end{equation}
This ensures that the rejection sampling remains efficient while maintaining the physical nature of the particle tracking.

The delta-tracking has a drawback in geometries with significant material heterogeneity, where the total cross sections of different materials vary considerably \cite{leppanen_2010}. A common example is a LWR fuel assembly containing localized heavy absorbers, such as control rods or burnable absorber pins. In these cases, the absorber's cross section dominates the majorant at low energy, even though it occupies only a small portion of the total volume. This leads to a low probability of sampling a physical collision in regions outside the absorber. In subsection \ref{sec41}, the impact of localized high absorbers, commonly found in LWR problems, on the computation will be evaluated.

\subsection{Majorant Cross Section Computation} \label{sec24}

One of the main challenges in the delta-tracking for spatially continuous material properties is specifying the majorant cross section (XS). The continuous distributions of fuel temperature, coolant density, and boron nuclide density significantly influence the XS across the delta-tracking region. Since each nuclide has different energy grids, the majorant XS is stored energy-wise in uniform majorant energy bins (MEB). Each MEB contains one or more energy grids of the point-wise XS in the cross-section library.

The calculation of the majorant XS begins by identifying the maximum microscopic total XS within a given MEB for different temperatures. Figure \ref{fig_2} compares the majorant microscopic XS of U-238 across a temperature range of 500 K to 1400 K with the point-wise microscopic XS of U-238 at 700 K. Once the majorant microscopic XSs for each nuclide are determined, they are multiplied by the corresponding highest possible nuclide densities within a given material to obtain the material-wise majorant XS. Finally, the majorant XS for each MEB is determined by selecting the maximum material-wise majorant XS within that MEB, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig_3}.

Numerical experiments suggest that the ideal number of MEBs is 1,200, distributed across thermal, resonance, and fast regions. If the number of MEBs is too small, rejection sampling becomes inefficient. Conversely, if too many MEBs are used, there is a higher likelihood of underestimating the majorant XS, where it may fall below the actual total XS of the material where the neutron collision occurs. To mitigate this, the maximum total XS is searched for within overlapping MEBs to ensure the largest macroscopic XS is captured for a given energy bin. By optimizing the number of MEBs and using overlapping MEBs, the probability of underestimating the majorant XS can be minimized.

\subsection{Calculation Flow} \label{sec25}

The simplified calculation flow of MC coupled multi-physics with spatially continuous material properties is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig_4}. The simulation begins with the evaluation of the majorant microscopic cross section, followed by the majorant macroscopic cross section. Particle delta-tracking in a continuous medium proceeds for several cycles, during which FET coefficients are tallied using Eq. \ref{eq5}. After several cycles of particle transport, a thermal-hydraulics (TH) update is conducted. If necessary, updates on critical boron concentration (CBC) and Xenon distribution are also performed.

During the TH update procedure, the two-dimensional power distribution is estimated using the truncated summation of Eq. \ref{eq1}, with the tallied coefficients obtained from previous cycles of particle tracking. This power distribution is then utilized by the TH solver to update the fuel, cladding, and coolant temperatures, as well as the coolant density. These updated values of two-dimensional fuel temperatures, and one-dimensional coolant and cladding temperatures, as well as coolant density, are stored for each fuel pin and serve as interpolation points during subsequent particle transport cycles. If equilibrium Xenon feedback is active, a similar process is employed to reconstruct the two-dimensional Xenon distribution across the fuel pin.

In previous work by Ellis \cite{ellis, ellis_2016}, functional expansion was used to represent the continuity of material properties, such as fuel temperature and coolant density. However, using interpolation instead of functional expansion to determine material properties at any point offers a key advantage: it requires fewer arithmetic operations than polynomial reconstruction, thus enhancing particle tracking efficiency.

The calculation of macroscopic cross sections for particle tracking in spatially continuous materials differs from conventional methods, where each cell is assigned unique material properties. In the case of particle tracking within spatially continuous materials, when a neutron is in the fuel pellet, a two-dimensional interpolation in both the axial and radial directions is employed to determine the fuel temperature at given spatial point. When a neutron in the coolant, a one-dimensional interpolation in the axial direction determines the temperature and density at given spatial point, followed by updates to the nuclide densities in the coolant. Lastly, for a neutron in the cladding, a one-dimensional interpolation in the axial direction determines the cladding temperature. After these temperatures and densities are determined, the microscopic cross section for a given energy and temperature is calculated for all nuclides within the material. Finally, the macroscopic cross section at the neutron's location is computed. These processes are summarized in Figure \ref{fig_5}.
