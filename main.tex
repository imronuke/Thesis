%			Introduction
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
Advancements in modern computing over the past 50 years have enabled the direct whole-core Monte Carlo coupled multi-physics simulations of large-scale light water reactors. Numerous examples of such simulations can be found in the literature. However, even with such "high-fidelity" methodology, their solutions still often cannot reflect the experimental solutions. The reasons could be many, but two of them are: first, typical direct whole-core Monte Carlo coupled multi-physics simulations often ignore intra-fuel-pellet temperature distribution which particularly crucial for correctly modeling spatial self-shielding effects. Second, typical direct whole-core Monte Carlo coupled multi-physics simulations often ignore thermal expansion of the reactor core materials.

Your introduction should be here. You may need a reference~\cite{ref_sample}.

\section{Spatially Continuous Material Properties} 

My second section starts with my equation, which can be written as 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:myeq}
\begin{split}
	A 		&= B + C, \\
    D + E	&= F.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Thus we have (\ref{eq:myeq}).

Fig.~\ref{fig:myfigure} is a sample figure.
