\section{Numerical Results} \label{s4}
With the theoretical background described in the previous sections, this section demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed framework in addressing multi-physics problems using several test cases, ranging from two-dimensional pin-cell problems to whole-core problems. Most of the problems presented in this thesis use material compositions and geometry adapted from the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications (VERA) core physics benchmark \cite{godfrey}. Additionally, ENDF/B-VII.1 was used for the MCS cross section library.

This section is divided into three subsections. Subsection \ref{sec41} provides the solutions for MC coupled multi-physics with spatially continuous material properties. While the solutions for thermal expansion are presented in subsection \ref{sec42}. Lastly, subsection \ref{sec43} presents the solutions for assembly and whole-core problems using both spatially continuous material and thermal expansion methods.
